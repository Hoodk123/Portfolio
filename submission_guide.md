# Milestone Submission Guide & Next Steps

Great job getting the code ready! Here is your checklist to finish the Week 14 Milestone for Shyaka Kevin.

## 1. Hosting the Website (Instructions)
You mentioned `shyakakevin.site.com`. Since you have the code now:

1.  **If using Vercel/Netlify (Recommended for React):**
    *   Push this code to a GitHub repository.
    *   Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel or Netlify.
    *   They will automatically deploy it.
    *   (Optional) If you have the custom domain `shyakakevin.site.com`, configure it in the Vercel/Netlify settings. If not, Vercel gives you a free URL like `shyakakevin-portfolio.vercel.app`. This works for the assignment too!

## 2. Completing the Content
Open `constants.ts` and `pages/Projects.tsx` to finalize specific details:
*   **Resume:** In `constants.ts`, replace `resumeLink: "#resume"` with the actual link to your Google Drive PDF Resume.
*   **Phase 2 Links:** In `pages/Projects.tsx`, look for the "Phase 2 Capstone Deliverables" section. Replace the `#` in the `href` attributes with your actual YouTube video link and Slide Deck PDF link.

## 3. Submission Steps (from your prompt)
1.  **Verify Live Site:** Ensure the site is deployed and accessible on the internet.
2.  **Create the Google Doc:**
    *   Open a new Google Doc.
    *   Paste your live URL (e.g., `https://shyakakevin.site.com` or the Vercel link).
    *   Type your full name and Student ID (if applicable) at the top.
3.  **Export to PDF:** Go to File > Download > PDF Document (.pdf).
4.  **Submit:** Upload this PDF to the "Website URL" component of your assignment.

## 4. Elevator Pitch
The page exists at `/elevator-pitch`. It is currently a placeholder, which explicitly satisfies the requirement: *"You simply need a page link off the main page... You do not need to have a video of your elevator pitch yet."*

## 5. QR Code (Bonus)
If you want a QR code for your resume or business card:
1.  Take your final deployed URL.
2.  Go to a free QR code generator (like Adobe or generic web tools).
3.  Paste your URL and save the image.

**Good luck, Shyaka! You demonstrate great potential by focusing on functionality and architecture.**
